**Grant Project Summary**

We have already invested $25,000 of our own funds and are just a few steps away from achieving our goals. To reach our vision, we seek an additional $86,028 in grant funding. This investment will allow us to enhance the UI/UX of our Phrase.Trade app, providing users with an engaging and immersive experience. 

A significant aspect of our project is the development of a captivating landing page that resonates with our target audience and clearly communicates the unique features of our platform. 

Moreover, we will focus on a seamless mainnet launch on the BNB chain to ensure full operational readiness. Once live, our goal is to attract high-quality users through various promotional activities, including rewards programs, Twitter Spaces, podcasts, and more. A substantial portion of the grant will be dedicated to marketing and promotions, as we believe that robust marketing is vital for gaining visibility, even for a great product.

We recognize the importance of capital to hire skilled marketing agencies that can help us reach a wider audience. This is why we are pursuing grant fundingâ€”to ensure that people discover and engage with our platform. We are excited about the dynamic BNB ecosystem and are confident that launching our mainnet on the BNB chain will be a pivotal step in our journey.
